# js-from-zero ⚡

learning javascript from scratch. pushing code every day.
no fancy stuff, just me actually writing code instead of watching tutorials.

## 📝 what i have done so far

### ✅ day 1 — variables
file → 01-basics/variables.js

learned the difference between var, let and const.
var is old and causes weird bugs so just avoid it.
let is for values that change, const is for values that dont.
also learned all basic data types like number, string, boolean, null and undefined.
template literals are way cleaner than joining strings with + signs.

### ✅ day 2 — functions
file → 01-basics/functions.js

learned different ways to write functions in javascript.
function declarations can be called before they are defined because of hoisting.
function expressions store a function inside a variable.
